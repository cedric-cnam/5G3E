This repository contains the data set created to support 5G network automation. The dataset contains time-series system metrics, built at different sampling rates, related to the ob-servation of multiple resources involved in 5G network operation: radio, computing and network resources. The variety of collectedfeatures  ranges  from  radio  front-end  metrics  to  physical  serveroperating system and network function metrics. Detailed description is presented in the article "An Open Dataset for Beyond-5G Data-drivenNetwork Automation Experiments".
